# 📊 Data Analysis Project - Project1

## 📌 Project Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Project1.ipynb`) that demonstrates a **complete data analysis workflow**.  
The project focuses on loading a dataset, cleaning it, exploring patterns, and visualizing insights to support decision-making.  

The notebook is structured in a way that makes it easy for learners and practitioners to understand the **end-to-end data analysis process**.

## ⚙️ Process / Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Import dataset into the notebook (CSV/Excel/Database).
- Inspect dataset shape (rows × columns).
- Identify data types and missing values.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Remove duplicates  
- Handle missing values (drop or fill)  
- Fix invalid entries (negative values, typos, etc.)  

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics of numerical and categorical features  
- Identify correlations between variables  
- Grouped analysis (e.g., by category, region, or time)  

### 4. Data Visualization
- Histograms, bar charts, scatter plots  
- Trend analysis (time-series plots if applicable)  
- Distribution plots for key variables  

### 5. Insights & Findings
- Highlight important patterns in the dataset  
- Identify top contributors (e.g., products, customers, or categories)  
- Detect seasonal trends or anomalies
